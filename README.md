What game you're going to make -
I Declare War.

What are the rules of the game-
Each player gets 26 cards. Each player turns over one card simultaneously; whoever turns over the highest card picks up the two cards and puts them face-down at the bottom of his pile.
The cards have the normal rank from highest to lowest: ace, king, queen, jack, and then 10 through 2.
The game continues in this manner until both players turn over a card of the same rank, at which point you enter a war. A war can progress in one of three ways.
Each player puts a card face-down on top of the tied card and then one face-up. Whoever has the higher face-up card takes all six cards.
Whoever wins the cards gathers them up and puts them at the bottom of her pile. The first person to get all the other playerâ€™s cards wins.
